This repository contains the third homework project of Statistical Methods in Data Science during the accademic year 2022/2023 [master degree in Data Science](http://datascience.i3s.uniroma1.it/it) in Sapienza University of Rome.

The goal of the project is to perform Friedman’s procedure as a proxy of multiple studies and apply it to fMRI
(functional magnetic resonance imaging) data in order to test whether the data from td (typically development) 
subjects and asd (autism spectrum disorder) subjects came from the same distribution or not.
